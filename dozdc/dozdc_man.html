<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>
dozdc - arbitrary precision dozenal calculator 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>dozdc [-ezdr]
[-k </b> <i>precision</i> <b>] [</b> <i>equation</i> <b>]</b> 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<b>dozdc</b> An arbitrary-precision Reverse
Polish Notation (RPN, postfix notation) calculator which works in dozenal
(base-12).  All normal arithmetic functions, plus trigonometry, some basic
constants (pi, euler, phi), logarithms, and other functions. Supports variables
of arbitrary user-defined names. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Options</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt>-z</dt>
<dd>Indicates that those functions which
take angles as arguments (trigonometric functions in particular) will take
them in zeniPis, the TGM unit.  This is the default. </dd>

<dt>-r</dt>
<dd>Indicates that those
functions which take angles as arguments (trigonometric functions in particular)
will take them in radians. </dd>

<dt>-d</dt>
<dd>Indicates that those functions which take angles
as arguments (trigonometric functions in particular) will take them in
degrees. </dd>

<dt>-e</dt>
<dd>Write the output in exponential notation. </dd>

<dt>-k precision</dt>
<dd>Print the
resulting output with  <i>precision</i> digits of precision.  By default, the output
is printed with four digits after the zenimal point.  If there is no fractional
part, no zenimal point or fractional digits will be printed, even if this
option is specified.  If the precision is too high, a message will be printed
noting this, and the precision will be reduced to the system&rsquo;s maximum. </dd>

<dt>equation</dt>
<dd>If
present, must be the final argument at the command line. Processes the equation,
prints the answer, and exits.  Must be entered within quotation marks so
that it&rsquo;s considered a single argument by the program. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Equation Syntax</a></h2>
The
syntax of an equation is fairly standard Reverse Polish Notation (also
called postfix notation or simply RPN). Each operator has either two arguments
(these are called "binary" operators) or one (these are called "unary"
operators).  Operators (like "+" or "cos") come  <i>after</i> their arguments (that
is, the numbers or variables they work on).  So, for example, rather than
writing "1 + 1", one writes "1 1 +"; rather than writing cos(30), one writes
"30 cos".  This has the benefit of being unambiguous (no parentheses are
necessary). 
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Operators</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt>=</dt>
<dd>Pops and prints the top of the stack; in other words,
gives you your answer.  The operations you request will be done after hitting
"enter"; however, no answer will be printed unless you put in an "=" and
hit that.  This allows long calculations to be split between lines without
having intermediate results, which may not be interesting, printed unless
you want them to be. </dd>

<dt>+, -, *, /</dt>
<dd>The basic arithmetic operators; they are all
binary.  They work precisely as one would expect them to.  "-" and "/" must
have their arguments in the right order; however, this is the same as the
order one would expect.  "x - y" is "x y -"; "x / y" is "x y /".  So this shouldn&rsquo;t
trip anyone up. Of course, one cannot divide by zero; trying will emit an
error message, and the numbers will be pushed back onto the stack, as they
were before the attempt. </dd>

<dt>%</dt>
<dd>The modulus operator, or "mod".  Internally this
is fmod(); as such, it works on floating-point numbers as well as integers.
 Like "/", one cannot divide by zero; trying will emit an error message,
and the numbers will be pushed back onto the stack, as they were before
the attempt. </dd>

<dt>k</dt>
<dd>Precision; this is a unary operator.  As such, its argument
comes prior to it.  It pops the last number and makes that value the new
precision.  Obviously, fractional precisions are meaningless, and will be
truncated to a whole number. Enter like so:  "8 k" will ask that answers
be printed to eight zenimal places.  If the value is too large, then, as
with the command-line option, it will simply be reduced to the largest possible
on your machine. </dd>

<dt>sin, cos, tan</dt>
<dd>Trigonometric functions that we&rsquo;re all familiar
with.  These are unary operators, so they take the number entered immediately
before them as their argument.  By default, they operate on zeniPis; this
can be changed.  See the command "rad" and the command-line option "r", as
well as "d" and the command-line option "d". </dd>

<dt>asin, acos, atan</dt>
<dd>Inverse trigonometric
functions.  Unary; used like the normal trigonometric functions.  Naturally,
these must be in the range of -1 to 1 (except for atan, which can take any
real number); if they are fed a different value, they politely cough it
back onto the stack and let the user know. They emit values in radians or
degrees, depending on the current angle setting. </dd>

<dt>sinh, cosh, tanh</dt>
<dd>Hyperbolic
trigonometric functions.  Unary; used like the normal and inverse ones. </dd>

<dt>z</dt>
<dd>Makes
those functions which work on angles use zeniPis rather than degrees or
radians.  This is the default.  See the command-line option "z". </dd>

<dt>d</dt>
<dd>Makes those
functions which work on angles use degrees rather than zeniPis or radians.
 See the command-line option "d". </dd>

<dt>rad</dt>
<dd>Makes those functions which work on
angles use radians rather than zeniPis or degrees.  See the command-line
option "r". </dd>

<dt>^</dt>
<dd>A binary operator; it raises its first argument to the power
of its second argument.  So "2 3 ^" has a result of 8; it means "2 raised
to the power of 3".  This can also be used to fake roots greater than two;
"8 1 3 / ^" raises 8 to the power of 1/3, which gives the cube root of 8.
</dd>

<dt>v</dt>
<dd>A unary operator; it takes the square root of its single argument.  So
"41 v" will yield 7.  Of course, one cannot take the square root of a negative
number; trying will emit an error message, and the attempted argument will
be pushed back onto the stack unchanged. </dd>

<dt>log</dt>
<dd>A unary operator; gives the
dozenal logarithm of its single argument. </dd>

<dt>logx</dt>
<dd>A unary operator; gives the
base-ten logarithm of its single argument.  It&rsquo;s worth noting that this computes
the base-ten logarithm of a <i>dozenal</i> number and emits it as a  <i>dozenal</i> result.
 This fact has tripped up the author of the program a few times when it
didn&rsquo;t match up to a base-ten logarithm from another calculator.  Trust the
result; make sure you&rsquo;re entering the same number and converting the result
to decimal.  It&rsquo;s correct. </dd>

<dt>ln</dt>
<dd>A unary operator; gives the natural logarithm
(the base is the euler number) of its single argument. </dd>

<dt>dlg</dt>
<dd>Pendlebury&rsquo;s dublogs;
these are logarithms with a base of two.  dozdc can handle only  <i>straight</i>
dublogs, not the  <i>mixed</i> dublogs, which are useful for some applications
but much harder to handle automatically. </dd>

<dt>logb</dt>
<dd>A binary operator; permits
computation of logs in an arbitrary base.  Its first argument is the number
the log of which is sought; its second is the base of that log.  So, for
example, "45 log" is equivalent to "45 10 logb"; "45 logx" is equivalent
to "45 X logb"; and "45 ln" is equivalent to "45 eul logb". </dd>

<dt>!</dt>
<dd>A unary operator;
takes the factorial of its single argument.  "5 !" yield "X0". </dd>

<dt>exp</dt>
<dd>A unary
operator; gives the euler number raised to the power of its single argument.
 So "2 exp" is equivalent to "eul 2 ^". </dd>

<dt>ldexp</dt>
<dd>A binary operator; it raises
2 to the power of its second argument, then multiplies it by its first.
 So, for example, "10 2 ldexp" will result in 40; 2^2 is 4, 10 * 4 is 40.
</dd>

<dt>abs</dt>
<dd>A unary operator; gives the absolute value of its single argument.  (That
is, it&rsquo;s positive, it leaves it as is; if it&rsquo;s negative, it makes it positive.)
</dd>

<dt>recip</dt>
<dd>A unary operator; gives the reciprocal of its single argument (that
is, one divided by that argument). </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Constants</a></h2>
dozdc provides a number of constants.
 These are the classic "transcendental" numbers, or at least a few of them.
 Of course, they are emitted in dozenal.  The "=" syntax is helpful here;
to learn the dozenal value of pi, for example, one need simply tell dozdc
"pi =", and pi, the value at the top of the stack, will be printed. 
<dl>

<dt>pi</dt>
<dd>Takes
no arguments; simply contains the value of pi. </dd>

<dt>eul</dt>
<dd>Takes no arguments; simply
contains the value of the euler constant. </dd>

<dt>phi</dt>
<dd>Takes no arguments; simply
contains the value of phi, the "Golden Ratio." </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Variables</a></h2>
dozdc has basic
variable handling; it is basic, but it&rsquo;s powerful enough for many uses. 
The program allows for up to fifty separate variables, each of which can
be arbitrarily named.  These names can be up to thirty characters long;
longer and they will be silently truncated by the program. The names must
begin with a dollar sign (&rsquo;$&rsquo;), after the manner of Perl or bash. 
<p> The first
time a variable name appears, the last value on the stack is popped off
the stack and assigned to it; ever after, when the variable name appears
it pushes that value back onto the stack.  The variable cannot be assigned
a new value. 
<p> So, for example, a typical usage scenario might be such: 
<p>
<b>1 3 / $result ($result == 1/3, or 0;4)</b> 
<p> <b>8 $result ^ = (prints 8 ^ 0;4, the
cube root of 8,</b> which is 2)" 
<p> They really are that simple. 
<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Comments</a></h2>
Comments
are available, and are useful in particularly long or complex files that
will be handed to dozdc for computation.  Because dozdc works by words,
not be lines, comments are word-based.  Fortunately, the words can be as
long as one wants.  It&rsquo;s important, however, to make sure that the comments
contain no spaces, tabs, or newlines, or dozdc will misinterpret the text
after the first one such as a command or number it needs to deal with. 
<p>
Comments are all proceeded with the &rsquo;#&rsquo; character, and include all characters
following it in the same word.  So, in our above variable example, we might
do the following: 
<p> <b>1 3 / $result</b> 
<p> <b>#_gives_us_exponent_for_cube_roots</b> 
<p> <b>8
$result ^ = </b> 
<p> This will accomplish the same thing, but make it clear what
"$result" is doing explicitly.  (Of course, one could just name the variable
"$cuberoot" or something similar, but we&rsquo;re doing examples here.) 
<p> One should
be aware that blank lines in the input files will mess up the results,
because of the way dozdc deals with words.  However, inserting a comment
(a line consisting solely of &rsquo;#&rsquo;) rather than a blank line will preserve
a correct result while still allowing the helpful whitespace.
